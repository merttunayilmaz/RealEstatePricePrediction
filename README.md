# RealEstateRegressionAnalysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using linear regression models. It utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels to analyze and model real estate data from the `reG_veri` dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Implementation of linear regression models using Scikit-learn
- Statistical analysis using Statsmodels
- Evaluation of model performance with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/merttunayilmaz/RealEstateRegressionAnalysis.git


## Data
The `reG_veri.csv` dataset includes various features related to real estate properties, such as average income, building age, number of rooms, etc., along with the property prices.

## Models
- **Model 1:** Linear regression without validation
- **Model 2:** Linear regression with train-test split
- **Model 3:** OLS regression using Statsmodels

## Results
The models are evaluated based on their MAE scores, with detailed coefficients and performance metrics provided for insights into the prediction capabilities.
